<p>After reading <a title="Barack Obamas Presidential directive that every Federal Government agency should have an API" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/06/01/barak-obama-directs-all-federal-agencies-to-have-an-api/">Barack Obamas Presidential directive that every Federal Government agency should have an API</a>, following <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-05-02/pdf/2011-10732.pdf">Executive Order 13571</a>, and part of the Whitehouse CIO's strategy, entitled "<a title="Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government-strategy.pdf">Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People</a>"--I'm excited about the potential for our government to change and evolve.</p>
<p>To help track the progress I've built a <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/federal_government.php" target="_blank">monitoring system</a> that I run nightly to see if each federal department or agencies has published their digital strategy. I am still evolving how I monitor, consume and publish data around the federal digital strategy.</p>
<p>I will be publishing as much of my work here as I can, including the research, stories, JSON data and the scripts I use to make it all happen.  So far I have the following PHP scripts that I use to pull each agencies digital strategy:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
    <li><a href="https://raw.github.com/kinlane/federal-government/gh-pages/snippets/check-federal-agencies-digital-strategy.php" target="_blank">Pull Federal Agencies Digital Strategy (PHP)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I have a crude MySQL table structure I put the federal agencies, their social and digital strategies into.  You can find the <a href="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/5465794" target="_blank">SQL script here</a>.</p>
<p>Once I have all the data about federal agencies, their social accounts and their digital strategy into a single database I do several things with it currently:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
    <li>Publish List of Federal Agencies (<a href="https://raw.github.com/kinlane/federal-government/gh-pages/data/federal-agencies.json" target="_blank">JSON</a>) (<a href="https://raw.github.com/kinlane/federal-government/gh-pages/snippets/publish-federal-agencies-json.php" target="_blank">PHP Script</a>)</li>
    <li>Publish List of Federal Agencies w/ Social (<a href="https://raw.github.com/kinlane/federal-government/gh-pages/data/federal-agencies-with-social.json" target="_blank">JSON</a>) (<a href="https://raw.github.com/kinlane/federal-government/gh-pages/snippets/publisih-federal-agencies-with-social-json.php" target="_blank">PHP Script</a>)</li>
    <li>Publish List of Federal Agencies w/ Digital Strategy (<a href="https://raw.github.com/kinlane/federal-government/gh-pages/data/federal-agencies-digital-strategy.json" target="_blank">JSON</a>) (<a href="https://raw.github.com/kinlane/federal-government/gh-pages/snippets/publish-federal-agencies-digital-strategy-json.php" target="_blank">PHP Script</a>)</li>
    <li>Publish List of Federal Agencies w/ Digital Strategy & Social (<a href="https://raw.github.com/kinlane/federal-government/gh-pages/data/federal-agencies-digital-strategy-with-social.json" target="_blank">JSON</a>) (<a href="https://raw.github.com/kinlane/federal-government/gh-pages/snippets/publish-federal-agencies-digital-strategy-with-social-json.php" target="_blank">PHP Script</a>)</li>    
</ul>
 <p>I pulled all the federal agencies originally from the <a href="http://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/federal-agency-directory/index.shtml" target="_blank">Federal Agency Directory API</a>, and each agencies social data using the <a href="http://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/social-media-registry.shtml" target="_blank">Federal Social Media Registry API</a>.</p>
 <p>I pulled all the logos for agencies by hand.  I recommend using the JSON listing of agencies and downloading them each locally, or <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-strategy/digital-strategy.zip" target="_blank">download the entire zip file and use</a>.</p>
 <p>You can view <a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/federal-agencies.html">all agencies w/ logos</a>, and <a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/digital-strategies.html">all agencies with their digital strategy on this site</a>.  Since this project is hosted at <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/federal-government/tree/gh-pages">Github you can also fork the project</a> and use the data for your own objectives.</p>
 <p>Every time I run the script to check all 246 agencies it automatically updates the JSON files above and commits here to Github.  So the JSON will always be up to date.</p>
 <p>I will continue to publish scripts, data, news and analysis here as I can.</p>
