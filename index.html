<p>After reading <a title="Barack Obamas Presidential directive that every Federal Government agency should have an API" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/06/01/barak-obama-directs-all-federal-agencies-to-have-an-api/">Barack Obamas Presidential directive that every Federal Government agency should have an API</a>, following <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-05-02/pdf/2011-10732.pdf">Executive Order 13571</a>, and part of the Whitehouse CIO's strategy, entitled "<a title="Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government-strategy.pdf">Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People</a>"--I'm pumped up about the potential for our government to change and evolve.</p>
<p>To help support this move by the Federal Government to an API driven architecture I wanted to provide two things:</p>
<ol class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/06/02/thoughts-for-federal-agencies-about-to-deploy-web-apis/">Oversight</a></strong> - A single page to get at information about this iniative, and hopefully some day it could evolve and be a programmatic discovery service for our Federal Government.</li>
<li><strong>Business of APIs</strong> - A simple guide to deploying each Federal Agencies, touching on the technical points, but emphasizing on the business building blocks that will be essential to each agency being successful.</li>
</ol>
p>Our federal government's Digital Strategy will be an ongoing project. &nbsp;To help track the progress I've built a monitoring system that will check nightly for each federal department or agencies digital strategy, parse each item and track on progress. &nbsp;As each agencies digital strategy evolves I will build in more tools for monitoring and engaging, as well as aggregating across all departments and agencies.</p>
