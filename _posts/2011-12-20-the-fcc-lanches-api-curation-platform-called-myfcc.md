{% include JB/setup %}<p>The FCC just launched a new platform that&nbsp;allows anyone to create, save and manage a customized page, built from widgets that pull content from FCC APIs, called MyFCC.&nbsp;
At first glance MyFCC might look like just another dashboard or start page, but it goes much further, as an API curation platform.To understand, you have to go back to the beginning and see the scope of the problem being solved.To deliver on its promise for a more open government, the FCC didnt just want a new website, they needed a platform.To do this the FCC embraced an API-driven methodology while building their web site, meant to standardize the way they deliver information between internal groups, government agencies and with the public.</p>
